                <h3>My Mission</h3>
                <p>My mission is to show others like myself that it is never too late in life to go after your passion.  I love building people up and helping to see their dreams become reality.  My mission is to inspire self-confidence in others by walking the walk for real or as my mom always says <em> "Don't just talk about it.  Be about it!"</em></p>

                <h3>Real Boss Moves</h3>
                <h4>What's That About? <small>Why Real?</small></h4>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block" >This is something else that I am passionate about.  I am going after my interests in coding and working on using the skills I have learned to help market myself. Real Boss Moves was initially just for me.  I wanted something that sounded strong.  It needed to be something that did not sound far fetched. It needed to be possible or achievable.</p>
                <h4>The <em>B.O.S.S.</em> Blog   <small>This stands for Be Optimistic, Strong, & Self-Confident.  That is what I think of when I think of a <em>'BOSS'</em>.</small></h4>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">When I say <em>BOSS</em> I don't mean like someone's boss on the job. No, that is asking too much.  No, I need people to work on being their own version of a superhero to themselves.  I need them to <em>'Boss Up'</em> in their own lives.  I need them to show up and show out in every aspect of their lives and revel in what makes them them.  I want to write about my journey, what inspires me, and hopefully help others in the same situation to be encouraged to take charge of their own lives either a bit a time or the whole shebang. </p>
                <h4>What about the Moves? <small>The moves are all on the individual.  If you don't take steps to change your life who will do it for you?</small></h4>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">I needed the name to have momentum, and it needed to be doable in the <em>"now"</em>  if you pardon the phrase.  Here I plan to focus on ways to move, my own health journey, and what others are doing to make their lives better.  What do they do to <em>'Boss Up'</em> daily?</p>

                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Currently just tees, but more is on the way.</p>
